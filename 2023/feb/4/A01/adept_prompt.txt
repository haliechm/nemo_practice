## Adept

This program takes in a list of ingredients (same as Novice) and then a list of menu item recipes. The program will print out information about the menu items.

Ingredient format:
{
  name: "",
  pricePerOunce: 0.0,
  isVegetarian: false,
  caloriesPerOunce: 0.0,
}

Menu Item format:
{
  name: "",
  <ingredientName>: <# of ounces of this incredient>,
  <ingredientName>: <# of ounces of this incredient>,
  <ingredientName>: <# of ounces of this incredient>,
  ...
} 

example of Menu Item:
{
  name: "Avocado Roll",
  Rice: 0.8,
  Eel:1.4,
} 


For each menu item, the program should produce print output describing: 
- the number of calories in the menu item
- the total cost of the ingredients used
- and an indication whether that menu item is "Vegetarian" or "Non-Vegetarian". A menu item is vegetarian if all of its component ingredients are vegetarian.

The output for each menu item should be formatted as follows (again, bracketed items are placeholders for values to be determined by the program):

```
<Menu_Item_Name>:
  <CalorieCount> calories
  $<Cost>
  <"Vegetarian" or "Non-Vegetarian">
```

CalorieCount should be rounded to the nearest integer. Cost should be rounded to two decimal places. 


For example, the following input:

```
[
  {
  name: "Rice",
  pricePerOunce: 0.12,
  isVegetarian: true,
  caloriesPerOunce: 37,
},
  {
  name: "Seaweed",
  pricePerOunce: 2.95,
  isVegetarian: true,
  caloriesPerOunce: 113,
},  
{
  name: "Avocado",
  pricePerOunce: 0.22,
  isVegetarian: true,
  caloriesPerOunce: 45,
},  
{
  name: "Salmon",
  pricePerOunce: 1.77,
  isVegetarian: false,
  caloriesPerOunce: 48,
},  
{
  name: "Yellowtail",
  pricePerOunce: 0.53,
  isVegetarian: false,
  caloriesPerOunce: 41,
},
{
  name: "Eel",
  pricePerOunce: 2.18,
  isVegetarian: false,
  caloriesPerOunce: 84,
},
]

[
  {
    name: "Avocado Roll",
    ingredients: [
      {
        name: "Rice",
        ounces: 0.5,
      },
      {
        name: "Avocado",
        ounces: 0.5,
      },
      {
        name: "Seaweed",
        ounces: 0.1,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "Unagi Nigiri",
    ingredients: [
      {
        name: "Rice",
        ounces: 0.75,
      },
      {
        name: "Eel",
        ounces: 0.75,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "Eel Roll",
    ingredients: [
      {
        name: "Eel",
        ounces: 0.6,
      },
      {
        name: "Rice",
        ounces: 0.4,
      },
      {
        name: "Seaweed",
        ounces: 0.2,
      },
      {
        name: "Avocado",
        ounces: 0.3,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "Salmon Sashimi",
    ingredients: [
      {
        name: "Salmon",
        ounces: 0.8,
      },
    ],
  },
]

Should produce the following output:
 
```
Avocado Roll:
  52 calories
  $0.47
  Vegetarian
Unagi Nigiri:
  91 calories
  $1.73
  Non-Vegetarian
Eel Roll:
  101 calories
  $2.01
  Non-Vegetarian
Salmon Sashimi:
  38 calories
  $1.42
  Non-Vegetarian
```

Note: create your own tests to test your program. I will have my own tests to verify. Put your code into adept.js
