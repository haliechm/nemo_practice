## Novice

This program takes in a list of ingredients used by a restaurant and prints out information derived from the list.

The input to the program will be a list of ingredients, where each ingredient has the following format:

{
  name: "",
  pricePerOunce: 0.0,
  isVegetarian: false,
  caloriesPerOunce: 0.0,
}


name is a single word token naming the ingredient. 
pricePerOunce will be a real value indicating the cost of the ingredient in dollars per ounce. 
isVegetarian will be the token "true" or "false" indicating whether the ingredient is vegetarian. 
caloriesPerOunce will be an integer indicating the caloric content of the ingredient per ounce.

The program should count the number of vegetarian ingredients and report which ingredients provide the highest and lowest ratios of calories per dollar.

The output should be formatted as follows:

```
Number of vegetarian ingredients: <NumberOfVegetarianIngredients>
Highest cals/$: <IngredientWithHighestRatio>
Lowest cals/$: <IngredientWithLowestRatio>
```

where the angle bracketed items are placeholders for the actual answers.

For example, the following input:

```
6
Rice 0.12 true 37
Seaweed 2.95 true 113
Avocado 0.22 true 45
Salmon 1.77 false 48
Yellowtail 0.53 false 41
Eel 2.18 false 84
```

Should produce the following output:

```
Number of vegetarian ingredients: 3
Highest cals/$: Rice
Lowest cals/$: Salmon
```
